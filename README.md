# Create React App with Mobx

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and used [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) for State Management.

This project is used to initial puposes only.

## Available Scripts

-   ### `yarn start`

    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    This mode will reloads the page upon making changes. Will also see any lint errors in the console.

-   ### `yarn build`

    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
    Your app is ready to be deployed!

    See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
